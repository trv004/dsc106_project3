    <p>
      We created an interactive radar chart that helps us compare and understand how our blood work stacks 
      up against the average lab values, according to our age, height, weight, and gender. We wanted the 
      visualization interface to feel personal and have some exploratory elements so that you can see the 
      typical blood results for someone with similar demographics as you, or just play with the sliders 
      and dropdown and see some patterns within the blood results. When filtering using the sliders and 
      dropdown, the radar chart recomputes the average results for the selected demographic, so you can 
      see the snapshot for that specific demographic and compare it to others or yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In designing this radar chart, we grouped all individual lab tests into five categories (Blood Cells &amp; 
      Inflammation, Electrolytes &amp; Metabolic Panel, Liver &amp; Protein Function, Coagulation &amp; Blood 
      Gases, and Kidney &amp; Waste Clearance). Each test is then scaled between 0 and 1 based on its 
      published reference range, allowing us to normalize and directly compare scores across tests.
    </p>

=======
  <div class="data-note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Lab test results were normalized using reference ranges specific to each test. For each result, the normalized value was calculated as:</p>

  <pre><code>
  Normalized Value = (Result - Reference Min) / (Reference Max - Reference Min)
  </code></pre>

  <p>Values are scaled between 0 and 1, where:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>0</strong> represents the lower bound of the normal reference range,</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> represents the upper bound,</li>
      <li>Values outside the reference range are capped at 0 or 1 and do not indicate how far out of range the original value was.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This normalization allows for comparability across different lab tests. For each user-defined group (based on age, gender, height, and weight), normalized values were averaged to produce a composite score for each test.</p>
