    <h4>The PokePlotters: Kate Feng, John Wesley Pabalate, Tracy Vu, Daniel Kong</h4>
    <p>
      We created an interactive radar chart that helps us compare and understand how differences in age, height, weight,
      and gender will affect lab values analyzing body health, based on average lab values from surgical patients. We wanted 
      the visualization interface to feel personal, and have some exploratory elements. For example, you can see the typical 
      lab results for someone with similar demographics as you, or just play with the sliders and dropdown and see some patterns 
      within the lab results. When filtering using the sliders and dropdown, the radar chart recomputes the average results for 
      the selected demographic, so you can see the snapshot for that specific demographic and compare it to the surgical patients.
    </p>

    <p>
      The process in designing this radar chart involved taking all the individual lab tests and grouping them into five categories 
      (Blood Cells & Inflammation, Electrolytes & Metabolic Panel, Liver & Protein Function, Coagulation & Blood Gases, and Kidney & 
      Waste Clearance). Since each lab test had different units, we normalized all the values first based on the reference values given 
      in each test (see data notes below). In the process of normalizing, we cut each value 
      at 0 and 1, so values outside of that range would be capped at those bounds, allowing for a cleaner radar chart. From there, we averaged 
      the normalized values in each group to get the scores per group. Furthermore, we added tooltips that include the lab results in each grouping
      and the averages per test.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of us created two visualizations, then we narrowed it down to one for the final submissions and brainstormed ways to improve it. The 
      creation of each brainstormed visual took approximately 1 to 2 hours total, with another 30 minutes to decide on a final visual and discuss 
      improvements to be made for the final product. We ended up going with the radar chart that John Wesley made, as we felt it was able to show the 
      breakdown of all the lab results in a clean format. From there, we decided to take a deeper dive into the data, making sure the units we were displaying 
      were all uniform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kate preprocessed the data by pivoting the DataFrame to include one column per test, normalizing the values to be scaled between 0 and 1, and then exporting 
      it to a JSON file. The preprocessing of the data took around 2 hours, as there was a lot to understand within the structure of the data and how to normalize 
      the values. From there, Tracy grouped the lab tests into five different health categories so the radar chart would not be too crowded. She recorded the average 
      test values within each group inside a tooltip. The grouping and start of the tooltips took around 1 hour total.
    </p>

    <p>
      John Wesley further customized the visualization by redesigning the filtering tools to be sliders instead of drop-down menus for easier user interaction. This 
      allows users to see the changes in the radar chart in real time as they move each slider. He also changed the tooltip to become larger when hovered over for a 
      more convenient user interface. In total, these modifications took around 1 hour to complete. Then Daniel added more information within the tooltips, including 
      the lab results that each group contains and the averages for each group.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, the part that took the longest was the data preprocessing. Another part that took longer to complete was the polishing of the radar chart design, done 
      by John Wesley. Other contributions included the creation of the repository (Tracy), the creation of the guiding question (Kate), and the write-up that everyone took part in.

  <div class="data-note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Lab test results were normalized using reference ranges specific to each test. For each result, the normalized value was calculated as:</p>

  <pre><code>
  Normalized Value = (Result - Reference Min) / (Reference Max - Reference Min)
  </code></pre>

  <p>Values are scaled between 0 and 1, where:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>0</strong> represents the lower bound of the normal reference range,</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> represents the upper bound,</li>
      <li>Values outside the reference range are capped at 0 or 1 and do not indicate how far out of range the original value was.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This normalization allows for comparability across different lab tests. For each user-defined group (based on age, gender, height, and weight), normalized values were averaged to produce a composite score for each test.</p>
